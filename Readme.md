# Ray Tracing in One Weekend

My implementation of the tutorial [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley.


## Requirements
- CMake 15.0
- A C++20-compliant compiler

## Build
```console
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B build/

```

## Run
